**Summary**:
           Designing a class for inheritance is hard work. You must document all of its self-use pattern, and once you've
           documented them, you must commit to them for the life of the class.
           If you fail to do this, subclasses may become dependent on implementation of the superclass changes.
           To allow others to write efficient subclasses, you may also have to export one or more protected methods.
           Unless you know there is a real need for subclasses, you are probably better of prohibiting inheritance by declaring
           your class final or ensuring that there are no accessible constructors.
