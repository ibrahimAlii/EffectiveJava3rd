**Summary**:
           The normal use of generics, exemplified by the collections APIs, restricts you to a fixed number of type parameters
           per container.
           You can get around this restriction by placing the type parameter on the ket rather than the container.
           You can use Class objects as keys for such typesafe hetergeneous containers.
           A Class object used in this fashion is called a type token.
           You can also use a custom key type. For example, you could have a DatabaseRow type representing a database row (the container),
           and a generic type Column<T> as its key.
