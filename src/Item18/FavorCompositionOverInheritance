**Inheritance is powerful, but it's a problematic because it violates encapsulation.**

/* It's appropriate only when genuine subtype relationship exists between the subclass and the superclass. Even then,
   Inheritance may lead to fragility if the subclass in a different package from the superclass and the superclass is not
   designed for inheritance. */
