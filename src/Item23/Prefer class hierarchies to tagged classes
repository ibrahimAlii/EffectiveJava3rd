**Summary**:
            Tagged classes are seldom appropriate.
            If you're tempted to write a class with an explicit tag field, think about whether the tag could be eliminated
            and the class replaced by a hierarchy.
            When you encounter an existing class with a tag field, consider refactoring it into a hierarchy.
