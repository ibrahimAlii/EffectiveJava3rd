**Summary:**
            There is simply no reason to use naming patterns when you can use annotations instead.
            That said, with the exception of toolsmiths, most programmers will have no need to define annotation types.
            But all programmers should use predefined annotation types that Java provides(Item 40, 27).
            Also, consider using the annotations provided by your IDE or static analysis tools.
            Such annotations can improve the quality of the diagnostic information provided by these tools.
            Note, however that these annotation have yet to be standardized, so you may have some work to do if you switch tools
            or if a standard emerges.
