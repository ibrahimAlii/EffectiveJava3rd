**Summary:**
            The advantage of enum types over int constants are compelling.
            Enums are more readable, safer, and more powerful.
            Many enums require no explicit constructors or members, but other benefit from associating data with each constant
            and providing methods whose behavior is affected by this data.
            Fewer enums benefit from associating multiple behaviors with a single method.
            In this relatively rare case, prefer constant-specific methods to enums that switch on their own values.
            Consider the strategy enum pattern if some, but not all, enum constants share common behaviors.
