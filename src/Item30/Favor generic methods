**Summary**:
            Generic methods, like generic types, are safer and easier to use than methods requiring their clients to put
            explicit casts on input parameters and return values.
            Like types, you should make sure that your methods can be used without casts, which often means making them generic.
            And like types, you should generify existing methods whose use requires casts.
            This make life easier for new users without breaking existing clients.
