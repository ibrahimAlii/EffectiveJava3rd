**Summary:**
            While you cannot write an extensible enum type, you can emulate it by writing and interface to accompany a basic
            enum type that implements the interface.
            This allows client to write their own enums (or other types) that implement the interface.
            Instances of these types can then be used wherever instances of the basic enum type can be used, assuming APIs
            are written in terms of the interface.
