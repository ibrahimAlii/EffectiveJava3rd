**Summary:**
           The essence of programming stream pipelines is side-effect-free function objects.
           This applies to all of the many function objects passed to streams and related objects.
           The terminal operation forEach should only be used to report the result of computation performed by a stream,
           not to perform the computation.
           In order to use streams properly, you have to know about collectors.
           The most important collector factories are toList, toSet, toMap, groupingBy, and joining.
