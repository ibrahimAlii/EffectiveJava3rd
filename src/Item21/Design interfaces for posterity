**Summary**:
            It's critically important to test each new interface before you release it.
            Multiple programmers should implement each interface in different ways.
            At minimum, you should aim for three diverse implementations.
            Equally important is to write multiple client programs that use instances of each new interface to perform various tasks.
            This will go a long way toward ensuring that each interface satisfies all of its intended uses.
            This steps allow you to discover flaws in interfaces before they are released, when you can still correct them easily.
            While may be possible to correct some interface flaws after an interface is releases, you cannot count on it.
