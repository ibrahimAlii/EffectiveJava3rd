The steps to write a skeletal implementation:
   1- Study the interface and decide which methods are the primitives in the term of which the others can be implemented.
These primitives will be the abstract methods in your skeletal implementation.
   2- Provide default methods in the interface for all of the methods that can be implemented directly atop the primitives,
but recall that you may not provide default methods for Object methods such as equals and hashCode, If


Summary:
        An interface is generally the best way to define a type that permits multiple implementations.
        If you export a nontrivial interface, you should strongly consider providing a skeletal implementation to go with it.
        To the extent possible, you should provide the skeletal implementation via default methods on the interface so that
        all implementors of the interface can make use of it.
        That said, restrictions on interface typically mandate that a skeletal implementation take the form of an abstract class.
