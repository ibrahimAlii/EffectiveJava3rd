**Summary:**
           The compiler can protect you from a great many errors if you use the Override annotation on every method declaration
           that you believe to override a supertype declaration, with one exception.
           In concrete classes, you need not annotate methods that you believe to override abstract method declarations
           (though is is not harmful to do so).
