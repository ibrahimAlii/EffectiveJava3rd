**Summary:**
           As of Java 8, lambdas ar by far the best way to represent small function objects.
           Don't use anonymous classes for function objects unless you have to create instances of types that aren't functional interface.
           Also remember that lambdas make it so easy to represent small function objects that it opens the door to functional
           programming techniques that were not previously practical in Java.
