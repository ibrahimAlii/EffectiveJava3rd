**Summary**:
            Never put multiple top-level classes or interfaces in a single source file.
            Following this rule guarantees that you can't have multiple definitions for a single class at compile time.
            This in turn guarantees that the class files generated by compilation, and the behavior of the resulting program,
            are independent of the other order in which the source files are passed to the compiler.
