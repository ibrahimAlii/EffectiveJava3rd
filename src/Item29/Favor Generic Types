**Summary**:
            Generic types are safer adn easier yo use than types that require casts in client code.
            When you design new types, make sure that they can be used without such casts.
            This will often mean making the types generic.
            If you have any existing types that should be generic but aren't, generify them.
            This will make life easier for new users of these types without breaking existing clients.
