**Summary**:
            There are four different kinds of nested classes, and each has its place.
            If a nested class need to be visible outside of a single method or is too long to fit comfortably inside a method,
            use a member class.
            If each instance of a member class needs a reference to its enclosing instance, make it nonstatic; otherwise make it static.
            Assuming the class belongs inside a method, If you need to create instances from only one location and there is a preexisting
            type that characterizes the class, make it an anonymous class; otherwise make it local class.
