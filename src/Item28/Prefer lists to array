**Summary**:
            Arrays and generics have very different type rules.
            Arrays covariant and reified; generics are invariant and erased.
            As a consequence, arrays provide runtime type safety but not compile-time type safety, and vice versa for generics.
            As a rule, arrays and generics don't mix well.
            If you find yourself mixing them and getting compile-time errors or warnings,
             your first impulse should be to replace the arrays with lists.
