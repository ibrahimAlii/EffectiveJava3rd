**Summary:"**
            If you find yourself writing a marker annotation type whose target is ElementType.Type, take the time to figure out
            whether it really should be an annotation type or whether a marker interface would be more appropriate.
            In a sense, this item is the inverse of Item 22, which says "If you don't want to define a type, don't use an interface"
            To a first approximation, this item says "If you do want to define a type, do use an interface"
