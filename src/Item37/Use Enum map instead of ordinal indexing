**Summary:**
           It's rarely appropriate to use ordinals to index into arrays: use EnumMap instead.
           If the relationship you are representing is multidimensional, use EnumMap<..., <EnumMap<...>>.
           This is a special case of the general principle the application programmers should rarely,
           if ever use Enum.ordinal (Item 35)
