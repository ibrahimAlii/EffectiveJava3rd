**Summary**:
            Using wildcard types in your APIS, while tricky, make the APIs far more flexible.
            If you write a library that will be widely used, the proper use of wildcard types should be considered mandatory.
            Remember the basic rule: producer-extends, consumer super (PECS).
            Also remember that all comparables and comparators are consumers.
